The following is a piece of Python code which is used to plot a sine wave using matplotlib, the code block format is based on kramdown syntax, it seems that the syntax is not highlighted, but only shown as a block,

~~~ python
def hello(msg):
	print msg;
	return;

hello("Nice to meet you!")
~~~

and this is another method provided in jekyllrb.org, it uses the liquid tag,

{% highlight ruby %}
def hello
	puts "hello world"
end
{% endhighlight %}

and here is a C++ example,

{% highlight c++ %}
class A
{
	public: 
		void hello()
		{
			cout << "Hello Wolrd" << endl;
		}
	
};
{% endhighlight %}
